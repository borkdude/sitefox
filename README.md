Web framework for ClojureScript on Node. **WIP**.

In the tradition of Django, Flask, and Rails.
Designed for indie devs who ship fast.
Battle tested on real sites.

## Quick start

Add Sitefox to your project as a dependency.

```
{:deps
 {io.github.chr15m/sitefox {:git/tag "v0.0.1" :git/sha "????"}}}
```

An example server with two routes, one of which writes values to the key-value database.

```clojure
(ns my.server
  (:require
    [sitefox.web :as web]
    [sitefox.db :refer [kv]]
    [sitefox.reloader :refer [reloader]]))

(defn home-page [req res]
  ; send a basic hello world response
  (.send res "Hello world!"))

(defn hello [req res]
  ; write a value to the db key value database
  (-> (kv "sometable")
    (.write "key" "42")
    (.then
      (fn []
        ; database write is done
        ; send a basic hello world response
        (.json res true))))

(defn setup-routes [app]
  ; flush all routes from express
  (web/reset-routes app)
  ; set up an express route for "/"
  (.get app "/" home-page)
  ; set up an express route for "/hello"
  (.post app "/hello" hello)
  ; statically serve files from the "public" dir on "/"
  ; (or from "build" dir in PROD mode)
  (web/static-folder app "/" (if (env "PROD") "build" "public")))

(defn main! []
  ; create an express server and start serving
  ; BIND_ADDRESS & PORT env vars set host & port.
  (-> (web/start)
    (.then (fn [app host port]
      ; reload the routes when the server js is modified (recompiled)
      (reloader (partial #'setup-routes app))
      ; set up the routes for the first time
      (setup-routes app)))))
```

## API

### Web server & routes

Sitefox uses the `express` web server with sensible defaults for sessions and logging.
Create a new server with `web/start` and set up a route which responds with "Hello world!" as follows:

```
(-> (web/start)
  (.then (fn [app host port]
    (.get app "/myroute"
      (fn [req res]
        (.send res "Hello world!"))))
```

Sitefox comes with an optional system to reload routes when the server is changed.
Your express routes will be reloaded every time your server code is refreshed (e.g. by a shadow-cljs build).
In this example the function `setup-routes` will be called when a rebuild occurs.

```
(defn setup-routes [app]
  ; flush all routes from express
  (web/reset-routes app)
  ; ask express to handle the route "/"
  (.get app "/" (fn [req res] (.send res "Hello world!"))))

; during the server setup hook up the reloader
(reloader (partial #'setup-routes app))
```

I recommend the [promesa](https://github.com/funcool/promesa) library for managing promise control flow.
This example assumes require `[promesa.core :as p]`:

```
(p/let [[app host port] (web/start)]
  ; now do something with app
  )
```

## Who

Sitefox was made by [Chris McCormick](https://mccormick.cx) ([@mccrmx](https://twitter.com/mccrmx)).
I iterated on it while building sites for myself and for clients.
